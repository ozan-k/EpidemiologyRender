A two-dimensional, or plane, spiral may be described most easily using polar coordinates, 
where the radius r is a monotonic continuous function of angle phi :

r=r(phi) 

The circle would be regarded as a degenerate case (the function not being strictly monotonic, but rather constant).

In x-y-coordinates the curve has the parametric representation:

x=r(phi) cos phi, y=r(phi ) sin phi
